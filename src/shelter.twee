:: shelter
You and Jessica walk around the island looking for survivors and material for your shelter

It's only you two on the island.

You gather materials to use for your shelter, while also looking for water holes to gather drinking water.

You find a bag of tools in the remaining aircraft that you use to help with the shelter.

By the end of the day you and Jessica built shelter, fire, and you've found food.
