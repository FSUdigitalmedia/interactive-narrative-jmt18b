:: own exploration
You head towards the crash on foot by yourself.

You run up the last hill, completely out of breath but ready to see the mess of the metal aircraft.

As you try and slow down towards the top of the hill you trip,
and it wasn't a hill, it was a cliff

You roll and fumble in the air, scared for what's to come

and as you come in contact with the rocky, unstable mountain floor,
you feel the wind knocked out of you and the world goes black

You died.
