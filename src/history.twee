You're now in Madagascar
An island stuck in a time warp, time moves slower
Years turn into weeks on Madagascar

You hear static, like a broken radio nearby
"They can't... find out"

Find out what?

"We put them there on that island, what if they can't figure it out?"

Figure what out?!

"They don't even like each other how will they flourish like we want them to?"

HUH?! [[FLOURISH?!|flourish]]
