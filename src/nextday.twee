:: next day
The next day you and Jessica plan out duties and tasks to accomplish every day

Throughout the next few weeks of living on the island you build a closer relationship with Jessica.
She tolerates you now.




A few years pass and you and Jessica have established a well built society with a water well, constant food source, a strong
shelter, transportation, and a community of animals that helped you manuever around the island throughout the [[years]].
