Moving on from the radio, you decide to go and find any survivors from the plane crash

Weeding through the brusch, you see movement up ahead...

"Jessica, is that you?" You ask in a loud wisper

You see her head pop through the tall grass, "Oh no seriously," is all she says when she sees your face

"Wait, I have [[news!|news]]"
