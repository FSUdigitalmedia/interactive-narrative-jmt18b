:: new crash
You and Jessica take the kids and head over the hills towards the crash

As you rise over the last hill you see a small metal space-like ship crashed into the meadows, profusely smoking with 
flames spewing out of the windows

All of you rush down the hill and towards the metal craft 

As you approach it there's a hand grasping one of the broken windows

You break the door and help the passengers out of the aircraft
